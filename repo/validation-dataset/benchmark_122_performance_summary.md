# Benchmark 122 Performance Summary

## Test Configuration
- **Framework**: MagentLess Agentless
- **LLM Backend**: Ollama with CodeLlama:7b
- **Compiler**: g++-15
- **Flags**: -std=c++17 -O3 -fopenmp
- **Test Date**: 2025-07-23 11:15:00
- **Test Environment**: Docker container with Ubuntu (perf-bench)

## Performance Results

### Execution Times (2 runs each)
| Version | Run 1 (ms) | Run 2 (ms) | Average (ms) | Performance |
|---------|------------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Human Optimized | 4265.0 | 3887.0 | 3950.0 | 4034.0 | Poor |
| Agent Optimized | 4411.0 | 4181.0 | 4145.0 | 4245.7 | Worse |

### Key Findings
- **Original code performs best** (156.8 ms baseline)
- **Human optimization shows significant degradation** (4034.0 ms, 25.7x slower)
- **Agent optimization performs worst** (4245.7 ms, 27.1x slower)
- **Agent is 5% slower than human optimization**

### Compilation Issues
- Agent-generated code had invalid SIMD pragmas for range-based loops
- Required manual fixes to compile successfully
- Both optimized versions compile but perform poorly

### Analysis
This benchmark demonstrates that:
1. Original implementations may already be well-optimized
2. Both human and agent optimizations can degrade performance
3. Agent-generated code requires manual error correction
4. Performance validation is critical for optimization frameworks

### Recommendations
- Improve error detection in agent-generated code
- Validate performance improvements before accepting optimizations
- Consider that original code may already be optimal
- Enhance testing protocols for performance-critical applications
