We are extremely delighted to release **Multi-SWE-Bench**! Multi-SWE-Bench addresses the lack of multilingual benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in real-world code issue resolution. Unlike existing Python-centric benchmarks (e.g., SWE-bench), our framework spans 7 languages (Java, Go, Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript, C, C++) with 1,632 high-quality instances, curated from 2,803 candidates by 88 expert annotators for reliability.
We aim to accelerate progress in automated issue resolution and RL, bridging the gap toward AGI. Let's join the **Multi-SWE-RL community** to expand datasets, tools, and research collaboration!

This repo provides Magentless, the [Agentless](https://github.com/OpenAutoCoder/Agentless) framework compatible with [multi-swe-bench](https://github.com/multi-swe-bench/multi-swe-bench).

## ‚ö° Features
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Tests top models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5/3.7, DeepSeek V3/R1, Doubao-Pro, etc.) across frameworks (Agentless, SWE-agent, OpenHands), yielding actionable insights.  
- **Multi-SWE-RL Community**: Open-source initiative for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) datasets. Initial release includes **4723 structured instances** across languages to advance RL research.  
- **Open Infrastructure**: Full data pipeline and tutorials open-sourced to foster community contributions and scalability.

## üìä Evaluation

### Introduction

This is the magnentless for multi-swe-bench.

For python language, please use the original [agentless](https://github.com/OpenAutoCoder/Agentless).

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/multi-swe-bench/MagentLess.git
cd Magentless

conda create -n magentless python=3.11
conda activate magentless
pip install -r requirements.txt
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)
```

### Data Preparation

Put multi-swe-bench jsonl data in './data', named '{language}_verified.jsonl'.

```bash
cd Magentless
mkdir data
cp java_verified.jsonl data/
...
```

Modify agentless/multilang/utils.py for other data.

### Repo cloning

Please clone all the repos into './repo'.

```bash
cd Magentless
mkdir repo
cd repo
git clone https://github.com/dubbo/dubbo.git
...
```

### Patch generation

First create './script/api_key.sh'.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=
export OPENAI_MODEL=
export OPENAI_EMBED_URL=
```

OPENAI_EMBED_URL is used for embedding retrieval. The default model is 'text-embedding-3-large', which can be modified in agentless/fl/Index.py.

Then modify './script/run.sh'.

```bash
export FOLDER_NAME= # all results in results/FOLDER_NAME
export SWEBENCH_LANG= # {java, javascript, typescript, c, cpp, go, rust}
export PROJECT_FILE_LOC= # See below
export DATASET=local_json # Do not modify
```

You can cache the repo structure in PROJECT_FILE_LOC for speedup, please refer to script/generate_structure.py

Finally run the run.sh

```bash
cd Magentless
bash ./script/run.sh
```

The prediction file and all the logs will be in results/FOLDER_NAME

### Evaluation

Please refer to [multi-swe-bench](https://github.com/multi-swe-bench/multi-swe-bench) repo.
